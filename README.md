# Challenge #1 Accessibility Challenge

## Description

Challenge #1 focused on accessibility and semantic HTML. The goal was to refactor the code to make it easier to read for accessibility tools by replacing the existing code with semantic HTML tags and elements. I replaced the <i>div</i> tags with <i>section</i> and <i>nav</i>> tags, and added <i>alt</i> text to all images. I also renamed the <i>footer</i> element, and an aside tag for the content that was isolated on the side of the page.

## Challenges

There were a couple of aspects to this project that were tricky. First of all, adding the <i>nav</i> tag took some extra thought, as the initial placement (outside of that section's <i>div</i> tags) caused the menu to appear differently than intended. Placing the <i>nav</i> tag within the <i>UL</i> element resolved the issue. I would have liked to add <i>alt</i> text to the background image, but since the background image is rendered through CSS, it is my understanding that that is not possible. Additionally, the formatting of the <i>H1</i> in the <i>Header</i> could make it tricky to read as a whole word (formatting tags break up the word "Horiseon"), but there is no way to add <i>alt</i> text to this element.
