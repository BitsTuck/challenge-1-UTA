# Challenge #1 Accessibility Challenge

Version 1.3
Deployed 20 September 2023

## Description

Challenge #1 focused on accessibility and semantic HTML. The goal was to refactor the code to make it easier to read for accessibility tools by replacing the existing code with semantic HTML tags and elements. I replaced the <i>div</i> tags with <i>section</i> and <i>nav</i>> tags, and added <i>alt</i> text to all images. I also renamed the <i>footer</i> element, and an <i>aside</i> tag for the content that was isolated on the side of the page.

## Challenges

There were a couple of aspects to this project that were tricky. I would have liked to add <i>alt</i> text to the background image, but since the background image is rendered through CSS, it is my understanding that that is not possible. Additionally, the formatting of the <i>H1</i> in the <i>Header</i> could make it hard to read as a whole word (formatting tags break up the word "Horiseon"), but there is no way to add <i>alt</i> text to this element.

## Credits

Initial source code and assets were provided through the University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp, housed on Github through The Coding Bootcamp account in the urban-octo-telegram repository, https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.

Additional guidance was given by instructor Leah Nelson and Ian Darland in office hours.
